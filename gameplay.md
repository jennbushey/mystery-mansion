## Game Play

Press the ON button. You will hear, "Welcome." If "Continue?
Y/N" appears on the screen, press YES.

First action: MOVE from the Entrance foyer through the doorway into the first room; it's room #11. (If you are using the Turn Cards, put a "Move" Card face up in front of you.)

Key the number 11 into the Electronic Organizer, press ENTER, and listen as Redstone tells you what furniture goes in the room. If you need to hear the list again, press REPEAT and Redstone will repeat it.

Arrange those pieces of furniture in the room however you want.

Second action: Now you may LOOK for a Clue! (Put a "Look" card in front of you if you wish.) Pick up any piece of furniture in Room #11 and read its number with the magnifier.

Key that number into the Organizer and press Enter. What did you hear? (See under "LOOK," page 6.) If you want, make a note of what you learn.

Third action: You have two options. You may LOOK at a second piece of furniture in the same room and get another clue, OR you may MOVE into an adjacent room (next door) and furnish it.
(Whichever you do, you may play the appropriate Turn Card if you wish.) Your first turn is over.

All subsequent players: The first part of your first turn must be to MOVE into Room #11, but do not key the number into the Organizer, since the first player has already furnished that room.
When the first part of your turn is over and you have made a MOVE inside the mansion, what you do next is up to you!
